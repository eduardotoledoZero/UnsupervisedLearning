# Unsupervised Learning , Data Minning and Recommenders

## Objective

This repository contains all my workshop about unsupervized modeling and data minning

## Category: PCA Analysis

In this case-workshop I apply PCA analysis  in the study of quality of life in different cities. To do this, I will make  use of the data that come  from the Qualified Almanac of Places. In this Almanac Boyer and Savageau rated 329 cities according to the following nine criteria:

   - Climate and Terrain
   - Accommodation
   - Health care and the environment
   - Crime
   - Transportation
   - Education
   - Arts
   - Recreation
   - Economy

## Category: Single Value Decomposition

In this case-workshop I apply SVD to do facial recognition. This application is known as eigenfaces, and although it is a rudimentary form of facial recognition, its results can be very interesting. The problem of eigenface was first studied by Sirovich and Kirby in 1987, extended in 1990, and its application to automated facial recognition was presented by Turk and Pentland in 1991.

In this workshop I will use the database known as Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW). This base is provided by the University of Massachusetts Amherst for use by the academic community for the evaluation of predictive models.

The base contains more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web and each face has been tagged with the name of the person represented. A subset of 1,680 of the people photographed have two or more different photos in the data set.

## Category: Clustering by KMeans and KMedoids


In this case-workshop I apply K-means and K-medoids to group faces of individuals. We will use the database known as Caras Olivetti. This base contains ten different images of 40 different people. For some people, images were taken at different times, varying lighting, facial expressions (eyes open/closed, smiling/not smiling), and facial details (glasses/no glasses). All images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with subjects in an upright frontal position (with tolerance for some lateral movement). This base is included in the scikit-learn library and was provided by T&T Laboratories Cambridge for the academic community to use for evaluating predictive models.

## Category: Hierarchical clustering and dbscan


The objective of this case-workshop is to analyze a  database about customers of a store and seek to find groups of customers that allow the generation of targeted marketing strategies. The database is located in the Laboratory Files in the data folder and has 200 observations and 5 variables:

- Id_Client: client identifier.
- Gender: customer's gender: Female, Male
- Age: age in years
- Income: annual income
- Spending_Score: is a variable that measures how often a customer buys in the store, with 100 being the highest score.

## Category: Collaborative filtering recommender systems : Music recommender


The goal of this case-workshop is to build a Music recommendation system using Last.fm data openly provided by grouplens to: "advance the theory and practice of social computing by building and understanding music recommendation systems  used by real people."

[See details](https://github.com/eduardotoledoZero/unsupervised_learning/blob/main/collaborative%20recommendation%20system/Music_Recommender.ipynb)


## Category: recommender systems  based on contents: Blog recommender

The objective of this case-workshop is to build a recommendation system based on the content of the posts.

## Category: hotspots analsys by means KDE: crime in Chicago

This case-workshop will use geographic data and kernel density estimation to analyze crime in Chicago
