# Unsupervised Learning

## Objective

This repository contains all my workshop about unsupervized modeling and data minning

## Category: PCA Analysis

In this case-workshop I apply PCA analysis  in the study of quality of life in different cities. To do this, I will make  use of the data that come  from the Qualified Almanac of Places. In this Almanac Boyer and Savageau rated 329 cities according to the following nine criteria:

   - Climate and Terrain
   - Accommodation
   - Health care and the environment
   - Crime
   - Transportation
   - Education
   - Arts
   - Recreation
   - Economy
