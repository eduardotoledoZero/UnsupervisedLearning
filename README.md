# Unsupervised Learning

## Objective

This repository contains all my workshop about unsupervized modeling and data minning

## Category: PCA Analysis

In this case-workshop I apply PCA analysis  in the study of quality of life in different cities. To do this, I will make  use of the data that come  from the Qualified Almanac of Places. In this Almanac Boyer and Savageau rated 329 cities according to the following nine criteria:

   - Climate and Terrain
   - Accommodation
   - Health care and the environment
   - Crime
   - Transportation
   - Education
   - Arts
   - Recreation
   - Economy

## Category: Single Value Decomposition

In this case-workshop I apply SVD to do facial recognition. This application is known as eigenfaces, and although it is a rudimentary form of facial recognition, its results can be very interesting. The problem of eigenface was first studied by Sirovich and Kirby in 1987, extended in 1990, and its application to automated facial recognition was presented by Turk and Pentland in 1991.

In this workshop I will use the database known as Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW). This base is provided by the University of Massachusetts Amherst for use by the academic community for the evaluation of predictive models.

The base contains more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web and each face has been tagged with the name of the person represented. A subset of 1,680 of the people photographed have two or more different photos in the data set.
